**1. 📖 Overview**<br>

This project is a predictive analytics system for heart disease diagnosis using Python. The goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on 14 key features. The system leverages various machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to achieve an accuracy of 88%, with a strong AUC-ROC score of 0.92.

**2. ✨ Features**
<br>🔍 **Data Preprocessing:** Standardization, encoding, and feature selection for optimal model performance.
<br>🤖 **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
<br>🔧 **Cross-Validation:** Techniques to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting.
<br>📊 **Visualization:** Comprehensive visualizations for data analysis and model interpretation.
<br>⚡ **Scalability:** Efficient processing of large datasets, with the capability to handle over 300,000 records.


**3. 📊 Data**<br>
The dataset used in this project consists of 14 features related to heart disease. Key features include:

<br>🧑‍💼 Age</br>
<br>🚻 Sex</br>
<br>🫀 Chest Pain Type</br>
<br>🩸 Resting Blood Pressure</br>
<br>🧪 Serum Cholesterol</br>
<br>🧪 Fasting Blood Sugar</br>
<br>🩺 Resting ECG Results</br>
<br>🏃‍♂️ Maximum Heart Rate Achieved</br>
<br>🦵 Exercise Induced Angina</br>
<br>📉 ST Depression Induced by Exercise</br>
<br>📈 Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment</br>
<br>🔬 Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy</br>
<br>🧬 Thalassemia</br>
<br>🎯 Target (Heart Disease Diagnosis)</br>

**4. 🧠 Modeling**<br>
The project implements four different machine learning models:

<br>🤖 Logistic Regression</br>
<br>🌳 Decision Tree Classifier</br>
<br>🧠 Naive Bayes</br>
<br>🧪 Support Vector Machine (SVM)</br>
These models are trained and evaluated using the processed dataset. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning are applied to optimize performance.

**5. 📈 Evaluation**<br>
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

<br>🎯 Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model's predictions.
<br>📊 AUC-ROC Score: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
<br>🗂️ Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of the true vs predicted classifications.
<br>⚖️ F1 Score: Balance between precision and recall.

**6. 📊 Visualization**<br>
Visualization plays a key role in this project. The following visualizations are included:

<br>📉 Histograms: Distribution of continuous features.
<br>📊 Correlation Heatmaps: Relationships between features.
<br>🗂️ Confusion Matrices: Model performance evaluation.
All visualizations are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

**7. 🏆 Results**<br>
The final system achieved the following results:

<br>🎯 Accuracy: 88%
<br>📊 AUC-ROC Score: 0.92
<br>⚖️ F1 Score: Improved by 10% through cross-validation.
<br>⏱️ Processing Time: Capable of handling large datasets with over 300,000 records in under 2 minutes.
