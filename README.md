Overview
This project is a predictive analytics system for heart disease diagnosis using Python. The goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on 14 key features. The system leverages various machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to achieve an accuracy of 88%, with a strong AUC-ROC score of 0.92.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Standardization, encoding, and feature selection for optimal model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
Cross-Validation: Techniques to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting.
Visualization: Comprehensive visualizations for data analysis and model interpretation.
Scalability: Efficient processing of large datasets, with capability to handle over 300,000 records.

Data
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and consists of 14 features related to heart disease. These include:

Age
Sex
Chest Pain Type
Resting Blood Pressure
Serum Cholesterol
Fasting Blood Sugar
Resting ECG Results
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
Exercise Induced Angina

Target (Heart Disease Diagnosis)
Modeling
The project implements four different machine learning models:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
These models are trained and evaluated using the processed dataset. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning are applied to optimize performance.

Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model's predictions.
AUC-ROC Score: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of the true vs predicted classifications.
F1 Score: Balance between precision and recall.
Visualization
Visualization plays a key role in this project. The following visualizations are included:

Histograms: Distribution of continuous features.
Correlation Heatmaps: Relationships between features.
Confusion Matrices: Model performance evaluation.
All visualizations are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Results
The final system achieved the following results:

Accuracy: 88%
AUC-ROC Score: 0.92
F1 Score: Improved by 10% through cross-validation.
Processing Time: Capable of handling large datasets with over 300,000 records in under 2 minutes.
