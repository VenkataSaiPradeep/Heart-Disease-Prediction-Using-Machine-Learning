📖 Overview
This project is a predictive analytics system for heart disease diagnosis using Python. The goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on 14 key features. The system leverages various machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to achieve an accuracy of 88%, with a strong AUC-ROC score of 0.92.

✨ Features
🔍 Data Preprocessing: Standardization, encoding, and feature selection for optimal model performance.
🤖 Machine Learning Models: Implementation of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
🔧 Cross-Validation: Techniques to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting.
📊 Visualization: Comprehensive visualizations for data analysis and model interpretation.
⚡ Scalability: Efficient processing of large datasets, with the capability to handle over 300,000 records.

📊 Data
The dataset used in this project consists of 14 features related to heart disease. Key features include:

🧑‍💼 Age
🚻 Sex
🫀 Chest Pain Type
🩸 Resting Blood Pressure
🧪 Serum Cholesterol
🧪 Fasting Blood Sugar
🩺 Resting ECG Results
🏃‍♂️ Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
🦵 Exercise Induced Angina
📉 ST Depression Induced by Exercise
📈 Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
🔬 Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
🧬 Thalassemia
🎯 Target (Heart Disease Diagnosis)
🧠 Modeling
The project implements four different machine learning models:

🤖 Logistic Regression
🌳 Decision Tree Classifier
🧠 Naive Bayes
🧪 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
These models are trained and evaluated using the processed dataset. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning are applied to optimize performance.

📈 Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

🎯 Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model's predictions.
📊 AUC-ROC Score: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
🗂️ Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of the true vs predicted classifications.
⚖️ F1 Score: Balance between precision and recall.
📊 Visualization
Visualization plays a key role in this project. The following visualizations are included:

📉 Histograms: Distribution of continuous features.
📊 Correlation Heatmaps: Relationships between features.
🗂️ Confusion Matrices: Model performance evaluation.
All visualizations are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🏆 Results
The final system achieved the following results:

🎯 Accuracy: 88%
📊 AUC-ROC Score: 0.92
⚖️ F1 Score: Improved by 10% through cross-validation.
⏱️ Processing Time: Capable of handling large datasets with over 300,000 records in under 2 minutes.
